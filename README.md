## ðŸš§ Under Construction ðŸš§

> The core functionality is currently under develop, so everything will be undergoing massive changes with **no** documentation to justify the changes. Once the core of the framework is built and the major decisions have been made, documentation will catch up. More than likely everything detailed here will change by the final framework, so use at your own discretion.
