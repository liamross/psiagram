# Use Psiagram

Psiagram is a monorepo, meaning it has multiple packages in one GitHub
repository. This ensures that inter-dependency between packages is maintained,
and allows for consistent versioning between psiagram and its plugins.

For instructions on how to use Psiagram, as well as documentation on the API,
use in your project, and all of the official plugins, see the
[Official Documentation](https://www.psiagram.org/).

For instructions on how to **work with the GitHub repository**, including
cloning, initializing and running, see the
[Contributing Document](https://github.com/liamross/psiagram/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
