Psiagram (/ˈ(p)sīəˌɡram/) - a simple, feature-rich, and extensible diagram
framework for JavaScript.

## Simple

**Psiagram is a dependency-free framework**, allowing easy integration in any
front end, regardless of the technology stack. It wraps all complex DOM
manipulation, which makes manipulating your diagrams as easy as setting new
properties.

To start creating using Psiagram, see the [basics section](./basics/README.md).

## Feature-rich

Psiagram provides robust events for every action which allow total control over
the framework, high-performance SVG Node and Edge components for rendering
diagrams, and an extensive but simple API to interact with the diagram.

For an in-depth look into some features, see the
[in-depth section](./in-depth/README.md).

## Extensible

Psiagram is set up to allow easy extensibility through plugins.

Check out some of the official plugins in the
[plugins section](./plugins/README.md).
