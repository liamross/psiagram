**Psiagram attempts to simplify graphing** by enabling complex and interactive
workflows and graphs to be built easily, in any project, and without the need
for external dependencies.

## Flexible

The entire framework and all supported plugins are built without any external
dependencies. This saves you from installing massive packages solely to support
your graphing framework, as well as ensuring easy integration into any front
end.

For an introduction to the framework, see the
[introduction section](./introduction/README.md).

## Simple

Psiagram takes much of the complexity out of generating workflows and graphs by
taking basic initial conditions and exposing a simple API. Most of the heavy
lifting is done within the framework, and within logical plugins.

To start creating using Psiagram, see the [basics section](./basics/README.md).

## Extensible

Psiagram exposes a robust API to allow listeners and plugins to enhance and
augment any part of a graph lifecycle.

Check out some of the official plugins in the
[plugins section](./plugins/README.md).
