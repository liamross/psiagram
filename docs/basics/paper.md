# Paper

Paper is the core of the Psiagram framework. If you don't have Paper, you have
nowhere to initialize or manipulate your graph! First, you need to import it
from the Psiagram npm package.

```js
import { Paper } from 'psiagram';
```

In order to use Paper, you need to initialize it. Initializing Paper has some
required properties, as well as many optional ones.
