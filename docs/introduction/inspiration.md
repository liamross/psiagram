# Inspiration

The JavaScript ecosystem has many solutions for rendering data. Diagramming and
workflows often require specific tooling in order to avoid building out most of
the logic externally. While open-source diagramming frameworks do exist, they
often depend on large external frameworks and libraries to do the heavy lifting.
In most cases, these are outdated in modern web development, meaning that entire
dependencies are brought into a project just to support the framework.

**Psiagram simplifies diagramming** by providing easy-to-use tools without any
external dependencies. However, it exposes a sophisticated API to ensure that
there is no limit to what you can build.

This ensures that any project can use Psiagram, no matter the complexity of the
diagramming needs, or the framework it's build upon.
