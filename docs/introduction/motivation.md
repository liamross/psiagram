# Motivation

The JavaScript ecosystem has many solutions for rendering data. Graphing and
workflows often require specific tooling in order to avoid building out most of
the logic externally. While open-source graphing frameworks do exist, they often
depend on **large external frameworks and libraries** to do the heavy lifting.
In most cases, these are **outdated** in modern web development, meaning that
entire dependencies are brought into a project just to support the graphing
framework.

**Psiagram attempts to simplify graphing** by enabling complex and interactive
workflows and graphs to be built easily, in any project, and without the need
for external dependencies.
